# File-Converter-Desktop-App
Utilizes various third party libraries to convert a user specified file to a user specified file format (e.g PDF - DOC). This conversion is asynchronous so a loading screen will be shown to the user while the file is converted and the converted file is stored in the original file's directory named "ConvertFile" with the file type being that which the user selected.
